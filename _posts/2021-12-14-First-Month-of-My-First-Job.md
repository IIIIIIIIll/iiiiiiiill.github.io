Finished my first month in the company. I would say it is generally OK.
On the negative side, it's not so well paid (although it is reasonably well paid). The company got strict rules and have piles of exams that I have to pass. 
But on the positive side I am in a good team with a good leader and groups of good colleagues.
And most importantly, the job I am doing is what I want to do. Not some random crap that are irrelevant.
Hopefully I can still remember to update this blog from time to time. Still think it's a good habit to keep.
