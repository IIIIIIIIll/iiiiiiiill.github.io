So it's almost the end of my MSc study at Imperial. Got a distinction in my course grades but really the most interesting and exciting part is the project.
It is still like a dream that I am actually working on something that could not influence our society and civilization so much.
That in the discussions happened in the lab sometimes becomes pure philosophical, and that brings the ultimate question: What is the right question.
I don't know, nobody in the lab knows, and very likely, no human knows. And that is exactly the charm of scientific researches. 
That is the ever lasting itchy of things remote, the determination to sail the forbidden seas.
