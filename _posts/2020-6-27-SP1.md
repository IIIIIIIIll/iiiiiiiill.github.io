So it's been a month!
I was lucky enough to be picked to board on a charted flight out of New York. Got quarantined for 14 days and made back home a few days ago. I would describe the journey to be well "epic".
On the day of flight the entire New York state went into curfew and when the governor announced that I was crossing the G.W. bridge. It literally felt like being in a fallout movie under that circumstance.
But anyways I got back home intact.  
By the way I am going to London for master's, fells great to be part of the Imperial College.
