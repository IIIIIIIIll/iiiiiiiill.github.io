This is it, I graduated. 4 years of laugh, tears, and memory, all gone with the changing time. It's hard to say, I don't know if I wish to repeat it if I have the chance. But I would say I am definitely looking to see a better tomorrow. Maybe some time, some day I will come back. But not now, not in the near future. The world is not flat anymore.
