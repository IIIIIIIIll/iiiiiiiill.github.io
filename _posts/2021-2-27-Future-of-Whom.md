It's almost the end of the second term at Imperial, and it is the time when I'm about to actively find a job. 
But I kinda don't know if I should. Find a job and spend the rest of my life with it, or get a PhD, or even just travel across the countries.
I can feel how my decisions of now could change myself for the next decade, or even the rest of my life. 
Anyways, we don't know future. But each of us do have a chance of creating one. It's my turn now.
